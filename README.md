# AliExpress Shopify Integration Tool

### Disclaimer

This tool was written by a much younger me. It is riddled with bugs and dubious technical decisions.

### Purpose

With dropshipping, there is a need to rapidly spin up stores with new AliExpress products. With this tool, you can:

1. Scrape the AliExpress product you wish to import to Shopify
2. Edit it how you like (name, description, tags, etc)
3. Export your product catalogue as a CSV to then import to Shopify
